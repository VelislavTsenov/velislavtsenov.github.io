						<b> Black Orchid </b> was created by perfume creators of fragrance company Givaudan in 2006. It was announced as oriental chypre. The top notes are French jasmine, black truffle, ylang-ylang, black currant and effervescent citrus. In the floral-spicy heart, dwells the Tom Ford's black orchid, imaginary more than real, and the base combines woodsy notes (patchouli and sandalwood), dark chocolate, incense, amber, vetiver, vanilla and balsam."<b> Black Orchid </b> is opulent, classically dark; its fragrance is in line with the best creations of the best perfume houses. Luxurious and sensual fragrance with rich dark trace of black orchid and spices, modern and timeless. " It remains to be said that Black Orchid is long lasting and with wide spread aura."This is not about an ordinary orchid, it's about something a little more strange and rare. I wanted the blackest orchid, and those aren't easy to find." The perfume is luxurious and the product range includes Eau de Parfum in 50ml (at US$90) and 100ml (at US$135) bottles, and limited edition of 5.000 15ml bottles of Parfum at US$600.
